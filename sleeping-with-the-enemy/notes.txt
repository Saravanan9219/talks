* Views are like ACTIONS (not Controllers)
* Actions are callable (by the time the router gets to them)
* Parameterized get_query_set without introducing django.contrib.auth
* Why add a comment, not a blog post? Admin system exists. Dates make more sense
  when adding a post.
* Form structure slide: Concrete examples
* Using a Form, not a ModelForm
* Forms render their own UI: Relevant to strong parameters
* Talk about how views handle multiple verbs
* SRP: Responsible for a single layer of the stack (not a single job)
* REST isn't relevant
* Showing URLs when mentioning views would be helpful
* A bit more on Python syntax, class attrs etc.
* Relationship between get_* and *, nothing to do with GET request (attr_accessor)
* Summarise some things at the end: A list of what we talked about
* A better conculsion, the wider point about communities talking to each other

* NO RSI BREAKS!

## TODO

* Set up a short URL for the slides
* Push slides to GitHub
