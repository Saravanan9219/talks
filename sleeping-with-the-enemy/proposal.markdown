# Sleeping with the enemy

## Talk description

In this session we'll go off the Rails and take a look at what our Pythonista
cousins are doing with Django.

I'll start with some live coding: recreating DHH's infamous 15 minute blog demo
using Django and explaining the building blocks of a Django app along the way.
I'll then take that app and use it to look at some design decisions Django
makes, and how they compare to Rails. You'll see convention over configuration
in places you didn't expect it, why Django doesn't need `attr_accessible` *or*
strong parameters, and how the template method pattern could change your life.

Why talk about Python at a Ruby conference? Seeing another way of doing things
forces us to think about what we're doing, challenges or validates the
assumptions we make about our work, and inspires us to try new things.
