      That’s not very helpful though.
      Even if I’m right and it <em>does</em> have a place, what is that place?

        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement"><cite>Wikipedia article on Progressive Enhancement</cite></a>
        summarises it by saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">
        <p>Progressive enhancement uses web technologies in a layered fashion that allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, while also providing an enhanced version of the page to those with more advanced browser software or greater bandwidth.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You can think of it as being a bit like a sandwich.
        A sandwich, like a Web application, solves a problem for its user.
        They are hungry, and so they want to eat something.
        The minimum viable sandwich is just a piece of bread.
        It's not exciting or fun, but it gets the job done.
        This is like the HTML in a progressively enhanced application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've got the bread,
        you can add more layers to make the sandwich more interesting.
        These are like the CSS and JavaScript you add to your application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that we shouldn't think of CSS and JavaScript as single layers.
        To stretch the sandwich analogy even further:
        some things—like your basic CSS—are more like the meat in the sandwich,
        others—like Web fonts, or responsive layouts—are more like condiments.
      </p>

        This gives us a lot of flexibility.
        If some of your lunch guests turn out to be lactose intolerant,
        you can still make them a pretty good sandwich
        by just skipping the cheese.
        Similarly,
        you can still offer your Web site's users a pretty good experience
        while:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          not serving Web fonts for users on mobile devices
          to improve loading time.
        </li>
        <li>
          writing JavaScript that doesn't fail for users who deliberately
          block specific services, like Google Analytics
          (see 
          <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/01/google-analytics-privacy-and-event-tracking/"><cite>Google Analytics, Privacy, and Event Tracking</cite></a>
          by <a class="h-card" href="http://stephaniehobson.ca/">Stephanie Hobson</a> for examples).
        </li>
        <li>
          treating technologies that aren't widely supported with care,
          so core functionality still works without them
          (e.g., at time of writing the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API#Browser_compatibility">Service Worker API isn't supported by <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> or Safari</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          failing gracefully when things go wrong.
          In 2013, the Government Digital Service in the UK
          reported that <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">1.1% of visitors didn't successfully run JavaScript, but only 0.2% disabled it</a>.

        The big challenger to progressive enhancement is single-page apps.
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Wikipedia article on single-page apps</a> says:
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">
        <p>
          A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site
          that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more
          fluid user experience similar to a desktop application.
          In an SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is
          retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources
          are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary,
          usually in response to user actions.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You can think of this as less like making a sandwich,
        and more like making a loaf of bread.
        Separately the ingredients don't solve the problem;
        a bowl of flour isn't the minimum viable loaf.
        All of the ingredients have to be present to make the loaf.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the Web,
        this means that the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and often some JSON data,
        all have to be loaded and working
        before the application will do anything at all.

        This claim of this approach is that it gives users
        an experience that is more similar to a native application,
        assuming they have a fast enough Internet connection
        and all of the required browser features.

        <li>
          The <dfn>parser</dfn> handles data coming from the network,
          and turns it into an internal representation the browser can use.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>object model</dfn> represents the
          <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and

        Adding JavaScript to the picture increases the complexity.

        There are two kinds of complexity in software.
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>Inherent complexity</dfn> is complexity that comes
        directly from the problem we're trying to solve.
        If we're building an app to handle filing taxes,
        the problem domain gives us high inherent complexity.
        Similarly, if we're building a Web application
        which needs to display updated information in real time,
        the inherent complexity calls for a complex architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>Incidental complexity</dfn> is complexity that comes
        from a developer's decisions and could have been avoided.
        If you've ever had to deal with a class that was hard to understand
        because it had many responsibilities all jumbled together,
        that was an example of incidental complexity.
        Similarly, taking responsibility for things the browser could do for us
        is an example of incidental complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can't avoid inherent complexity
        but we <em>can</em> avoid incidental complexity,
        and we should because it makes life worse for everyone:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It masks bugs and introduces performance problems
          which is bad for users.
        </li>
        <li>
          It makes code hard to understand and change
          which is bad for developers.
        </li>
        <li>
          It makes things take longer to build or change
          which is bad for businesses.

      <h3>Progressive enhancement helps</h3>
      <ul class="plain reveal">
        <li>Choose <strong>where</strong> to increase complexity.</li>

      </ul>

    <div class="notes">
      <p>
        Progressive enhancement helps us avoid incidental complexity
        in two ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        It allows us to choose where to increase complexity
        by allowing us to choose which layers of technology we apply
        and which features we apply them to.
        Low value features can be kept very simple to reduce maintenance costs,
        while high value features can be enhanced with all manner of
        bells and whistles.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also allows us to choose when to increase complexity
        by allowing us to release a simple version of a feature—or even
        a whole application—and iterate several times before choosing
        to invest in complex enhancements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare this to a single page application:
        even the simplest features usually require changes to
        a server-side <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
        and a client-side JavaScript application,
        along with all of the UX responsibilities
        of distributed systems and managing our own network requests.

        Hopefully by now you're convinced that progressive enhancement
        can be a useful technique.
        Just one question remains: when should we use it?
      </p>
      <p>
        That depends on the inherent complexity of what you're building,
        and specifically the interactions that you need for your core
        functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's consider three examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>—a platform for reading
            and writing articles—requires interactions with low inherent
            complexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the most basic Web technologies support reading and creating
            documents.
            It's a clear candidate for progressive enhancement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>—a chat application—is
            all about real time communication in multiple channels.
            It needs real time updates, and to maintain state on things
            that aren't currently being displayed and may not be know
            by a server-side application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those are core interactions with high inherent complexity,
            and I'd have a hard time seeing how to use progressive enhancement
            to implement it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>—a Web based
            document editor—is somewhere in between.
            It's real time collaboration features certainly have
            high inherent complexity, but it's still useful without those
            features.
          </p>
          <p>
            A server-rendered, read-only version
            would make documents created with Google Docs
            accessible to a wider range of devices,
            and make them available faster on all devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reading documents is a small percentage of what Google Docs does,
            but it's valuable,
            and covers a large percentage of my own use-cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall: if I were building Google Docs
            I'd use progressive enhancement.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where does your application fit on that scale?
        I'm willing to bet very few of us are working on problems
        with the inherent interaction complexity of Slack.
      </p>

      <h2>So, where does progressive enhancement fit in today’s Web?</h2>

      <p>
        Almost everywhere.
        Probably in your application,
        reducing complexity to
        save your users from bugs,
        your developers from pain,
        and your business from higher costs.
