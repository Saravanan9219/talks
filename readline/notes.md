# Readline: Your other editor

* We don't always type code in Vim
* If we're not in Vim, there's a good chance we're using Readline
* Vi and Emacs modes: I tried Vi mode, but ...
    * It surprises me by not being vim
    * There's no mode indicator (yet, coming in the next version of Bash)
    * I can edit the current command in $EDITOR anyway (C-x C-e, in Bash)
    * For editing single lines, I prefer it!
* Show off what Emacs mode can do
    * Transpose characters and words
    * Yank
    * alt+d : delete word forwards
    * ctrl+alt+e : expand
    * `ctrl+_` : undo
    * `alt+_`  : yank last arg
* inputrc
* irb on OS X
* zsh caveats
